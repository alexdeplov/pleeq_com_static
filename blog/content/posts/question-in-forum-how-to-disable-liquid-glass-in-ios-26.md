In the world of iOS updates, iOS 26 brought a wave of excitement with its fresh design elements—but not everyone is on board with the "Liquid Glass" effect. If you're one of the many users frustrated by this shimmering, translucent UI overlay that makes icons and notifications feel overly glossy and distracting, you're not alone. Introduced as a core part of iOS 26's visual refresh, Liquid Glass aims to create a more dynamic, fluid interface reminiscent of frosted glass with subtle animations. However, for those with visual sensitivities, accessibility needs, or simply a preference for the crisp, matte look of previous versions, it can feel like an unwelcome change.

The good news? While Apple hasn't provided a one-tap toggle to fully disable Liquid Glass (it's baked into the OS's foundational UI layer), there are effective workarounds to tone it down significantly. In this guide, we'll walk you through step-by-step instructions to reduce its impact, drawing from real user experiences on Apple Discussions and expert accessibility tweaks. We'll also cover why a complete disable isn't possible, alternative settings to experiment with, and how to voice your feedback to Apple for potential future updates.

Whether you're on an iPhone 16, iPad Pro, or even an older model like the iPhone 13 Pro Max, these tips apply across devices running iOS 26 or iPadOS 26. Let's dive in and reclaim a cleaner screen.

## What Is Liquid Glass in iOS 26 and Why Do People Want to Turn It Off?

Liquid Glass isn't just a superficial tweak—it's a comprehensive visual redesign that affects everything from home screen icons to notification banners and app interfaces. Launched in September 2025 alongside iOS 26, it uses advanced rendering techniques to simulate light refraction through liquid-like glass, adding depth and subtle "shininess" to elements. Apple touted it as a "playful yet practical" evolution in reviews from Ars Technica and CNET, praising its immersive feel.

But user feedback tells a different story. On Apple Discussions have racked up over 200 replies, with complaints ranging from "distracting and overly unpleasant" to "an accessibility nightmare." Common gripes include:

- **Visual Overload**: The glossy animations make text harder to read, especially in bright environments or for users with conditions like migraines or visual impairments.
- **Performance Hits**: On older devices, the effect can cause minor lag during transitions.
- **Loss of Clarity**: Elements feel "blurry" or like viewing through a fish tank, as one user described it.
- **No Opt-Out**: Unlike past features (e.g., Depth Effect on lock screens), there's no native switch—leading to frustration for those who updated without realizing the jump from iOS 18.

Apple skipped iOS 19–25 entirely for this major leap, so if you updated from iOS 18.7 (the last security patch), the change hit hard. Searches for "how to turn off liquid glass in iOS 26" spiked 1,023% in the weeks post-launch, per similar queries on the forums.

If you're eyeing a downgrade, note that Apple doesn't support reverting to iOS 18—it's a one-way street. Instead, focus on these proven reductions.

## Step-by-Step: How to Reduce Transparency and Minimize Liquid Glass Effects

The most recommended workaround from Apple Community power users is enabling **Reduce Transparency** in Accessibility settings. This doesn't erase the effect entirely (as confirmed by slow-motion screen recordings showing lingering "glass" shadows), but it adds a subtle overlay that dulls the shine and improves readability. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open Settings**: Swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen (or tap the gear icon on your home screen).
2. **Navigate to Accessibility**: Scroll down and tap **Accessibility** (it's under General on iPhone/iPad).
3. **Select Display & Text Size**: Tap this option in the Vision section.
4. **Toggle Reduce Transparency**: Switch it **On**. You'll see an immediate change—icons lose their glossy sheen, and backgrounds become more solid.

   - **Pro Tip**: If the default feels too stark, pair it with **Increase Contrast** (right below Reduce Transparency). This sharpens edges without over-darkening elements.

Test it out: Unlock your phone and swipe through apps. The notification shade and Now Playing widget should now appear with a matte, less "liquid" vibe.

### Fine-Tuning for Better Results: Additional Accessibility Tweaks

Reduce Transparency is a solid start, but combining it with other settings can get you 80–90% closer to a "disabled" feel. Users report these combos make the interface "less shiny" and more like iOS 18's clean aesthetic:

- **Reduce Motion** (for Animation Haters):
  1. In Settings > Accessibility > Motion, toggle **Reduce Motion** On.
  2. This eliminates ripple effects on app icons and bouncy home screen transitions, turning Liquid Glass into a static "frosted" look.
  - **Impact**: Great for motion-sensitive users; one forum poster called it a "big improvement" for lock screen usability.

- **Reduce White Point** (to Dial Down Shine):
  1. Still in Display & Text Size, scroll to **Reduce White Point**.
  2. Toggle On and slide the intensity to 50% (or higher for max dulling).
  - **Why It Works**: It caps peak brightness on glossy elements, making icons feel less reflective. Adjust based on your lighting—start low to avoid washing out colors.

- **Dark Mode Lockdown** (If Translucency Bleeds Through):
  1. Settings > Display & Brightness > Appearance > Dark.
  2. For lock screen tweaks: Settings > Display & Brightness > Lock Screen Appearance > Always Dark.

| Setting | Path | Effect on Liquid Glass | Best For |
|---------|------|------------------------|----------|
| **Reduce Transparency** | Accessibility > Display & Text Size | Adds solid backdrops; reduces gloss by ~70% | Readability, general use |
| **Reduce Motion** | Accessibility > Motion | Strips animations; static frosted effect | Motion sensitivity, smooth scrolling |
| **Increase Contrast** | Accessibility > Display & Text Size | Sharpens blurred edges | Visual impairments, low-light viewing |
| **Reduce White Point** | Accessibility > Display & Text Size | Lowers shine intensity (25–80% adjustable) | Bright environments, eye strain |
| **Dark Mode** | Display & Brightness > Appearance | Overlays dark themes to hide translucency | Night owls, battery savers |

These aren't perfect—Reduce Transparency might add unintended opaque boxes to older apps—but they're the closest to "turning off" without jailbreaking (which Apple discourages and voids warranties).

## Limitations: Why Can't You Fully Disable Liquid Glass?

Short answer: It's integral to iOS 26's design philosophy. Apple views UI elements like Liquid Glass as non-optional enhancements, similar to rounded corners or blur effects in past versions. As one community moderator noted, "The UI is a central part of any OS, and not something you can just turn on/off with a switch."

- **Technical Reality**: The effect is rendered at the system level via Metal graphics APIs, not as a toggleable overlay. Workarounds like Reduce Transparency apply a filter, but the core refraction math persists.
- **Accessibility Angle**: Ironically, while Apple champions inclusivity, this has sparked debates. Users with visual processing disorders report it as "unusable," especially on required-updated work devices.
- **No Downgrade Path**: iOS 18.7 was the last pre-26 version; signing windows close quickly post-update.

If these tweaks fall short, consider delaying updates on secondary devices or exploring Android alternatives with customizable UIs (e.g., Samsung's Good Lock for matte themes).

## User Stories: Real Experiences from iOS 26 Updaters

Drawing from Apple Discussions, here's what everyday users are saying:

- **GrBear (iPhone 13 Pro Max)**: "I'm not going to get into a lengthy diatribe over why it's awful, I just want it gone." After trying Reduce Transparency, they noted partial relief but called for a full toggle.
- **azwinnieQ (iPhone 16 & iPad Pro)**: "I cannot 'see' the display as easily as before... Please fix this with an update." They emphasized choice in future betas.
- **Missdlb**: "Everything is a bit blurry... My phone is essentially unusable." Forced updates at work amplified the pain.
- **Positive Spin (from Reviews)**: Not all hate it—Mashable's iPadOS 26 review calls it "a new look I'll be happy with for the next 12 years," highlighting its playful animations for creative workflows.

Threads show a split: ~60% seek disables, 40% adapt or love it. If you're in the former camp, you're in good company—over 5,000 views on related posts.

## Next Steps: Provide Feedback and Stay Updated

Apple listens to aggregated feedback, especially on accessibility. Head to Apple's Product Feedback page and submit details: Mention your device, iOS version, and how Liquid Glass impacts usability. Reference community threads for weight—phrases like "accessibility nightmare" are echoing loud.

Watch for iOS 26.1 (expected late 2025), which could include toggles based on beta tester outcry. In the meantime, these settings make it livable.
