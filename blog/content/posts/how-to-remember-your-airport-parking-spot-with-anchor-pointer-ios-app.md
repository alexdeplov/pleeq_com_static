Problem:
Returning from a trip and can't remember if you parked in Terminal A or B? Was it level 4 or 5? After a long flight, the last thing you need is to search endless parking rows.

Solution:
Save your parking spot in Anchor Pointer before heading to your terminal. When you return, just follow the arrow straight to your car - no more wandering through airport parking structures!
