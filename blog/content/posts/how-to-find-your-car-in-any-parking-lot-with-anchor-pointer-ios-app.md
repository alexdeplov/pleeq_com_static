Spent 20 minutes walking around the mall parking lot? Can't remember if you parked on level B2 or B3? Yeah, we've all been there. It's frustrating and wastes so much time.

Just open Anchor Pointer when you park and tap to save your spot. When you're done shopping, the app will point you directly to your car. No more wandering around clicking your key fob!
