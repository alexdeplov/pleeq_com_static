				<p>
					Please check these settings. They should be ON:<br/>
<strong>iOS Settings</strong> → <strong>Privacy</strong> → <strong>Location services</strong> → <strong>System Services:</strong></p><img class="screenshot" src="findCariOSNetworkSettings.jpg"><p>· Cell Network Search<br/>· Compass Calibration<br/>· Location-Based Alerts<br/>· Motion Calibration & Distance<br/>· Setting Time Zone<br/>· Wi-Fi Networking<br/>· Significant Locations</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Is it Necessary to Enable Wi-Fi Networking?</h1>
				<p>Yes. The GPS in an iPhone is an "Assisted GPS", meaning that it will use known locations of Wi-Fi transmitters to locate the phone if the phone happens to be receiving a Wi-Fi signal that it "knows" the location of.  Notice that this does not mean that the Wi-Fi transmitter has to be yours. Your iPhone could be picking up a Wi-Fi station that has been moved from its "known" location.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Is it Possible to Find a Car or a Location Inside a Building?</h1>
				<p>No. Currently, GPS technology inside your iPhone can't pinpoint your location if you are inside a building. Best results are obtained when the app is used outdoors.</p>
