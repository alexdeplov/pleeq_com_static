					<summary>Why Enable Networking?</summary>
					<p>The GPS in an iPhone is "Assisted GPS," meaning it will use known locations of Wi-Fi transmitters to locate the phone if it detects a Wi-Fi signal from a known location. According to Apple this doesn’t require the Wi-Fi transmitter to be yours; it could be from any nearby Wi-Fi station.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Indoor Location Possible?</summary>
					<p>No. Currently, GPS technology in your iPhone can’t pinpoint your location inside buildings. For best results, use the app outdoors.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Everything Fails?</summary>
					<p>In certain situations—such as densely populated urban areas, indoor spaces with limited connectivity, use of iPhone cases with magnets, or while in a car—the compass accuracy may be affected by magnetic interference. We recommend using the app outdoors, without magnetic covers, and not inside the car.</p>
