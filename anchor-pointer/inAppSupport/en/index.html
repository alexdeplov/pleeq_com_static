				<h1>Moving to a Subscription Model</h1>
				<p>We're a small, two-person team. 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️ We've been developing this app since 2013 (almost 11 years now), but the market has changed significantly.</p>
				<p>Please support indie development, allowing us to add new features and provide ongoing support — without it, continued development wouldn't be possible.</p>
				<p>For any questions, please send us a <a href="mailto:deplovsbrothers@gmail.com?subject=Pleeq Software Support">message</a>.</p>

				<h1>Compass Arrow Still Doesn’t Move?</h1>
				<p>If you have an iPhone case with magnets, please remove it and try again.<br/>

				<h1>Is It Necessary to Enable Networking & Wireless?</h1>
				<p>Yes. The GPS in an iPhone is "Assisted GPS," meaning it will use known locations of Wi-Fi transmitters to locate the phone if it detects a Wi-Fi signal from a known location. This doesn’t require the Wi-Fi transmitter to be yours; it could be from any nearby Wi-Fi station.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Is It Possible to Find a Car or Location Inside a Building?</h1>
				<p>No. Currently, GPS technology in your iPhone can’t pinpoint your location inside buildings. For best results, use the app outdoors.</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Enabled All Settings But Location Is Still Wrong?</h1>
				<p>In certain situations—such as densely populated urban areas, indoor spaces with limited connectivity, use of iPhone cases with magnets, or while in a car—the compass accuracy may be affected by magnetic interference. We recommend using the app outdoors, without magnetic covers, and not inside the car.</p>
