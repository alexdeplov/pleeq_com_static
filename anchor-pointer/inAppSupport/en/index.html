				<h1>Is it Necessary to Enable Networking & Wireless?</h1>
				<p>Yes. The GPS in an iPhone is an "Assisted GPS", meaning that it will use known locations of Wi-Fi transmitters to locate the phone if the phone happens to be receiving a Wi-Fi signal that it "knows" the location of.  Notice that this does not mean that the Wi-Fi transmitter has to be yours. Your iPhone could be picking up a Wi-Fi station that has been moved from its "known" location.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Is it Possible to Find a Car or a Location Inside a Building?</h1>
				<p>No. Currently, GPS technology inside your iPhone can't pinpoint your location if you are inside a building. Best results are obtained when the app is used outdoors.</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>I Have Enabled All Settings, But the Location is Still Wrong, Why?</h1>
				<p>In certain situations, such as densely populated urban areas, indoor spaces with limited connectivity, when using iPhone case with magnetics, or when traveling by car, the accuracy of the compass may be affected by magnetic interference. We recommend using the app outdoors, without magnet covers, and not inside the car.</p>
